# Mushroom Type Prediction by supervised classification model 
## Supervised learning model
In supervised learning algorithm is used to predict  in classification algorithm is used to predict the categorical veriable we used different types of algorithms like decision tree , random forest , knn , svm to get a best classification model .
## Introduction
Mushroom hunting (otherwise known as "shrooming") is enjoying new peaks in popularity. In this case study we will learn which features spell certain death and which are most palatable in this dataset of mushroom characteristics. We have a Mushroom Data which classified if mushroom are Editable or Poisonous , According to features in it.   We will try to use this data to create a model, Which tried to predict if a mushroom is edible or poisonous Dataset Information: This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota Family Mushroom.Each species is identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. The Guide clearly states that there is no simple rule for determining the edibility of a mushroom; no rule like "leaflets three, let it be’’ for Poisonous Oak and Ivy.

# Problem statement 

We have a Mushroom Data which classified if mushroom are Editable or Poisonous , According to features in it.   We will try to use this data to create a model, Which tried to predict if a mushroom is edible or poisonous.
